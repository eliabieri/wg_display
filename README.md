The web interface allows the users to configure system aspects like the background color used on the display or various configuration options of the different widgets.

## 🚀 Getting started

Building the project is easy

```bash
# Native build
make
# Raspberry PI Zero 1 / Zero W / Zero WH
make app_arm
# Raspberry PI 2 / 3 / 4 / Zero 2 W
make app_armv7
```

Then simply copy over the generated binary to the target and run it

## 🛠️ Assembling the hardware

WG Display is best deployed on a Raspberry PI and a cheap display hat.

```
💡 Even a Raspberry PI Zero is sufficient! 
The application is very ressource efficient and generally only utilizes around 3% CPU on a Raspberry PI 3B.
```

Some displays that are tested to be good

- [5" MIPI DIS Display](https://t.ly/fWl3)
  - ✨ Requires no driver
  - ✨ Includes stand
  - 📐 Large enough to display ~ 6 widgets
  - 💲💲💲
- [3.5" HAT Display](https://t.ly/DfWJ)
  - ✨ Includes enclosure for wall mounting
  - ⚠️ Requires a [driver](https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show/blob/master/MHS35-show)
  - 📐 Large enough to display ~ 3 widgets
  - 💲
- [3.5" HAT HDMI Display](https://t.ly/l2Rd)
  - ✨ Requires no driver
  - 📐 Large enough to display ~ 3 widgets
  - 💲💲
- Any other display you might find
  - WG Display uses the terminal for rendering, so there are no special display requirements

## 👏 Writing your own widget

Want your WG Display to show you

- 🥳 the upcoming events in your favorite night club
- 🚮 the trash calendar in your municipality
- 🍺 beers on sale in your local supermarket?  

You've got two options

- [Write your own widget](docs/write_new_widget.md). It's easy using the provided guide and reference implementations
- In case you don't feel capable of writing it yourself, open a [feature request](https://github.com/eliabieri/wg_display/issues/new) and tag it using the `widget request` label

## 📖 Documentation (rustdocs)

The rustdocs can be built using

```bash
make docs
```

This generates three seperate documentations, one for each crate

[app](app/target/doc/wg_display/index.html): ```app/target/doc/app/index.html```  
[common](common/target/doc/common/index.html): ```common/target/doc/common/index.html```  
[frontend](frontend/target/doc/frontend/index.html): ```frontend/target/doc/frontend/index.html```

## 🔒 Safety

This project uses `#[forbid(unsafe_code)]` in all crates to ensure that no `unsafe` Rust is ever added to the project
