# 🛠️ Implementing a new widget

## What is a widget

A widget represents a piece of information displayed on the display.  
It has a name and a corresponding value, that is updated dynamically.  
Additionally, a widget consumes a configuration, that is entered by the user via the dashboard.  

## WebAssembly

Widgets are [WebAssembly components](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model), that implement the interface defined by the `exports` of the [wg_display_widget_wit](https://eliabieri.github.io/wg_display_widget_wit/).  
They are loaded by the WG Display application and run using the [wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev) WebAssembly runtime.

Using WebAssembly, as the basis for the widgets, has the following advantages:

- Widgets are sandboxed and can't directly access the host system
- Widgets can be written in any language that compiles to WebAssembly
- Widgets can run on any platform that is supported by `wasmtime`

## 🚦 How to get started

For implementing a widget in Rust, there is a [template repository](https://github.com/eliabieri/wg_display_widget_rs) that can be used to get started.  
It contains the instructions on how to build and distribute the widget.

Template repositories for other languages will be added in the near future.

## 📦 Distribute the widget

See [Add your widget to the store](https://github.com/eliabieri/wg_display_widget_rs/blob/main/README.md#-add-your-widget-to-the-store) for more information.
